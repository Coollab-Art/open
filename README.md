# open

Open any link, folder or file. Cross-platform.

## Including

To add this library to your project, simply add these two lines to your _CMakeLists.txt_:

```cmake
add_subdirectory(path/to/open)
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE Cool::open)
```

Then include it as:

```cpp
#include <open/open.hpp>
```

## Usage

⚠ You might really want to consider calling
```cpp
// It's very important to set the locale to handle paths with characters like é and 分 on Windows
#ifdef _WIN32
std::setlocale(LC_ALL, ".65001");
#endif
```
at the beginning of your application, to make sure special characters are handled properly.

```cpp
Cool::open_link("https://github.com/Coollab-Art/open");
```

## Running the tests
